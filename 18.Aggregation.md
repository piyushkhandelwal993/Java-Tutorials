### **Introduction to Aggregation**

**Aggregation** is a type of association in object-oriented programming where one class contains another class as a part of its state. Unlike composition, aggregation implies a relationship where the contained objects can exist independently of the container class.

#### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Definition of Aggregation**
   - Aggregation is a “has-a” relationship.
   - It represents a whole-part relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole.

2. **Difference Between Aggregation and Composition**
   - **Aggregation**: The lifetime of the contained object is not dependent on the lifetime of the container object.
   - **Composition**: The contained object’s lifetime is dependent on the container object’s lifetime.

3. **Real-World Examples**
   - **Aggregation Example**: A `Library` has `Books`. A `Book` can exist independently of a `Library`.
   - **Composition Example**: A `House` has `Rooms`. A `Room` cannot exist independently without a `House`.

4. **Implementing Aggregation in Java**

   - **Creating Aggregated Classes**
     ```java
     public class Book {
         private String title;

         public Book(String title) {
             this.title = title;
         }

         public String getTitle() {
             return title;
         }
     }

     public class Library {
         private List<Book> books;

         public Library() {
             books = new ArrayList<>();
         }

         public void addBook(Book book) {
             books.add(book);
         }

         public List<Book> getBooks() {
             return books;
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Code Explanation**
   - The `Library` class has a list of `Book` objects.
   - The `Book` class exists independently and can be created and manipulated without needing a `Library`.

6. **Edge Cases and Considerations**
   - **Null References**: Ensure that `null` values are handled when adding books to the `Library`.
   - **Thread Safety**: If `Library` is accessed by multiple threads, ensure that the list is thread-safe.

7. **Exceptions to Handle**
   - **IllegalArgumentException**: Handle cases where invalid books are added to the `Library`.
   - **ConcurrentModificationException**: Handle situations where the collection is modified during iteration.

### **Coding Exercises**

1. **Exercise 1: Basic Aggregation**
   - Create a `Department` class with a list of `Employee` objects.
   - Implement methods to add and list employees in the department.
   - Test the class by adding multiple employees and displaying them.

   ```java
   public class Employee {
       private String name;

       public Employee(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }

       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }
   }

   public class Department {
       private List<Employee> employees;

       public Department() {
           employees = new ArrayList<>();
       }

       public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
           employees.add(employee);
       }

       public void listEmployees() {
           for (Employee employee : employees) {
               System.out.println(employee.getName());
           }
       }
   }

   // Test
   public class TestAggregation {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Department department = new Department();
           department.addEmployee(new Employee("Alice"));
           department.addEmployee(new Employee("Bob"));
           department.listEmployees();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Exercise 2: Aggregation with Optional Book Removal**
   - Extend the `Library` class to include a method for removing a `Book` by title.
   - Handle cases where the book to be removed does not exist in the library.

   ```java
   public class Library {
       private List<Book> books;

       public Library() {
           books = new ArrayList<>();
       }

       public void addBook(Book book) {
           books.add(book);
       }

       public void removeBook(String title) {
           for (Iterator<Book> iterator = books.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
               Book book = iterator.next();
               if (book.getTitle().equals(title)) {
                   iterator.remove();
                   return;
               }
           }
           System.out.println("Book not found.");
       }

       public List<Book> getBooks() {
           return books;
       }
   }

   // Test
   public class TestAggregation {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Library library = new Library();
           library.addBook(new Book("Java Basics"));
           library.addBook(new Book("Advanced Java"));
           library.removeBook("Java Basics");
           library.removeBook("Non-existent Book");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Exercise 3: Thread Safety in Aggregation**
   - Modify the `Library` class to be thread-safe by using `Collections.synchronizedList`.

   ```java
   public class Library {
       private List<Book> books;

       public Library() {
           books = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
       }

       public synchronized void addBook(Book book) {
           books.add(book);
       }

       public synchronized void removeBook(String title) {
           for (Iterator<Book> iterator = books.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
               Book book = iterator.next();
               if (book.getTitle().equals(title)) {
                   iterator.remove();
                   return;
               }
           }
           System.out.println("Book not found.");
       }

       public List<Book> getBooks() {
           synchronized (books) {
               return new ArrayList<>(books);
           }
       }
   }

   // Test
   public class TestAggregation {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Library library = new Library();
           library.addBook(new Book("Java Basics"));
           library.addBook(new Book("Advanced Java"));

           Runnable addTask = () -> {
               library.addBook(new Book("Concurrency in Java"));
           };

           Runnable removeTask = () -> {
               library.removeBook("Java Basics");
           };

           Thread t1 = new Thread(addTask);
           Thread t2 = new Thread(removeTask);

           t1.start();
           t2.start();
       }
   }
   ```

### **Checkpoint Questions**

1. **What is the primary difference between aggregation and composition?**
2. **In the given `Library` and `Book` example, how does the `Library` class handle the lifecycle of `Book` objects?**
3. **What exceptions might you encounter when managing collections in a multi-threaded environment?**

### **Post-Lecture Questions**

1. **Explain a real-world scenario where aggregation is a better choice than composition.**
2. **How would you handle the case where a `Library` needs to keep track of book editions and ensure that adding or removing a book handles these editions properly?**
3. **Describe a situation where failing to use aggregation correctly could lead to issues in your application design.**
