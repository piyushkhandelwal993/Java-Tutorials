## 1. Introduction to Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### 1.1 Basic Terminology
- **Superclass (Parent Class):** The class whose features are inherited.
- **Subclass (Child Class):** The class that inherits the features of the superclass.
- **Inheritance:** The mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.

### 1.2 Syntax
To create a subclass, use the `extends` keyword.

```java
class Parent {
    // Superclass code
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Subclass code
}
```

## 2. Types of Inheritance

### 2.1 Single Inheritance
A subclass inherits from one superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Multilevel Inheritance
A subclass inherits from another subclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void breathe() {
        System.out.println("This mammal breathes air.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple subclasses inherit from one superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}
```

### 2.4 Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces)
Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes, but it can be achieved through interfaces.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The duck flies.");
    }

    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("The duck swims.");
    }
}
```

## 3. Key Concepts in Inheritance

### 3.1 Constructor in Inheritance
Constructors are not inherited, but the subclass constructor can call the superclass constructor using `super()`.

```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Child constructor");
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Method Overriding
A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

### 3.3 `super` Keyword
The `super` keyword refers to the superclass and can be used to access superclass methods and constructors.

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        super.display();
        System.out.println("Child class");
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Access Control
Inheritance respects access control. `private` members of the superclass are not accessible in the subclass.

```java
class Parent {
    private void show() {
        System.out.println("Private method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // show() is not accessible here
}
```

## 4. Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts

### 4.1 Method Hiding
Static methods are not overridden but hidden.

```java
class Parent {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Parent");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("Static method in Child");
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Final Keyword
- **Final Class:** Cannot be subclassed.
- **Final Method:** Cannot be overridden.

```java
final class FinalClass {
    // This class cannot be subclassed
}

class Parent {
    final void finalMethod() {
        System.out.println("Final method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // Attempting to override finalMethod() will cause a compile-time error
}
```

### 4.3 Multiple Inheritance Ambiguities
Using multiple interfaces with conflicting method names requires careful design to avoid ambiguities.

## 5. Coding Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Inheritance
Create a class `Vehicle` with a method `move()`. Create subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that inherit from `Vehicle` and override `move()` to print specific messages.

### Exercise 2: Multilevel Inheritance
Create a class hierarchy `Shape -> Circle -> ColoredCircle`. Implement methods to display the shape, the circle radius, and color information.

### Exercise 3: Interface Implementation
Define interfaces `Readable` and `Writable`. Create a class `Document` that implements both interfaces and provides concrete implementations for their methods.
