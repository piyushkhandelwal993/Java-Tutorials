### **Lecture Plan: Java OOPs Concepts**

#### **1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

**Definition:**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of methods (functions or procedures). The primary goal of OOP is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs.

**Four Pillars of OOP:**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

**Why OOP?**
- Promotes code reusability
- Enhances code maintainability
- Facilitates abstraction and modularity

**Example:**
Consider a simple real-world analogy: a car. The car itself is an object with attributes like color, model, and speed, and methods like start, stop, and accelerate.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?
2. List the four pillars of OOP.
3. How does OOP improve code maintainability?

#### **2. Encapsulation**

**Definition:**
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object’s components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse.

**Key Points:**
- **Private Access Modifier:** Restricts access to the members of the class.
- **Public Methods:** Provide controlled access to private members.
- **Getter and Setter Methods:** Used to access and update private data.

**Example:**
```java
class Car {
    private String model;
    private int year;

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Mutability:** If the class exposes mutable objects (like arrays), encapsulation can be broken if proper care is not taken.
  - Example: Returning a reference to a mutable array.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is encapsulation?
2. How do getter and setter methods contribute to encapsulation?
3. What are the risks associated with exposing mutable objects in a class?

#### **3. Inheritance**

**Definition:**
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of an existing class. The class that inherits is called the **subclass** (or child class), and the class being inherited from is called the **superclass** (or parent class).

**Types of Inheritance:**
- **Single Inheritance:** A class inherits from one superclass.
- **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class is derived from a class that is also derived from another class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple classes inherit from one superclass.

**Example:**
```java
class Vehicle {
    String brand;

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is starting");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    int doors;

    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting");
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Diamond Problem:** Occurs in multiple inheritance (not directly applicable to Java but relevant when using interfaces).
- **Method Overriding:** Pay attention to access modifiers and exceptions in overridden methods.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is inheritance?
2. Explain the difference between single and multilevel inheritance.
3. How does Java handle multiple inheritance?

#### **4. Polymorphism**

**Definition:**
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even though they share the same name. It comes in two forms: **compile-time (method overloading)** and **runtime (method overriding)**.

**Method Overloading:**  
Same method name with different parameters in the same class.

**Method Overriding:**  
Same method name and parameters, but in different classes (parent and child).

**Example of Method Overloading:**
```java
class MathOperations {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

**Example of Method Overriding:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Overloading and Type Promotion:** Ambiguity can arise if type promotion is involved.
- **Overriding with Different Return Types:** Requires covariance in return types.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is polymorphism?
2. Explain method overloading with an example.
3. How does method overriding differ from method overloading?

#### **5. Abstraction**

**Definition:**
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what the object does rather than how it does it.

**Abstract Class:**  
A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (without implementation).

**Interfaces:**  
A contract that a class can implement, forcing the class to provide implementations for the methods declared in the interface.

**Example of Abstract Class:**
```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();

    void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Animal is breathing");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

**Example of Interface:**
```java
interface Movable {
    void move();
}

class Car implements Movable {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Multiple Interfaces:** Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces, which can lead to complexity in method resolution.
- **Abstract Methods:** Must be overridden in the first concrete subclass.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is abstraction in Java?
2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
3. Can a class implement multiple interfaces? Provide an example.

#### **6. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Create a class `Person` with private fields for name and age. Use encapsulation to protect these fields, and provide public methods to get and set their values. Demonstrate creating an instance of `Person` and modifying its fields.

**Exercise 2:**  
Design a class hierarchy involving `Vehicle`, `Car`, and `Bike`. Implement a method `startEngine()` in `Vehicle` and override it in `Car` and `Bike`. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling `startEngine()` on an array of `Vehicle` objects.

**Exercise 3:**  
Write a program that demonstrates the concept of interfaces. Create an interface `Playable` with a method `play()`. Implement this interface in classes `Piano` and `Guitar`. Demonstrate calling `play()` on different objects of these classes.
