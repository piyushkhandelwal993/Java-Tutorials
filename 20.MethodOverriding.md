## **1. Introduction to Method Overriding (10 minutes)**

### **What is Method Overriding?**
Method Overriding is a feature in Java that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The overriding method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

### **Key Points:**
- **Inheritance**: Overriding is possible only in a child class that inherits from a parent class.
- **Same Signature**: The method in the subclass must have the same method signature (name, return type, and parameters) as in the superclass.
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method overriding is a key aspect of achieving runtime polymorphism in Java.
- **Annotations**: The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is intended to override a method in the superclass. Itâ€™s not mandatory but is good practice.

### **Example:**
```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.sound();  // Outputs: Dog barks
    }
}
```

### **Checkpoint Question:**
- What is method overriding, and how is it different from method overloading?

## **2. Detailed Explanation of Method Overriding (15 minutes)**

### **Conditions for Method Overriding:**
- **Access Modifiers**: The overriding method cannot have a more restrictive access modifier than the method in the superclass.
- **Final Methods**: Methods declared as `final` cannot be overridden.
- **Static Methods**: Static methods cannot be overridden; they can be hidden instead.
- **Constructors**: Constructors cannot be overridden.

### **Example with Access Modifiers:**
```java
class Parent {
    protected void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent display()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void display() {  // More permissive access level
        System.out.println("Child display()");
    }
}
```

### **Tricky Concepts & Edge Cases:**
- **Covariant Return Types**: The return type of the overriding method can be a subclass of the return type declared in the overridden method.
- **Exception Handling**: The overriding method can throw fewer or more specific exceptions, but not new or broader ones.

### **Example of Covariant Return Types:**
```java
class Parent {
    Parent get() {
        return this;
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    Child get() {
        return this;
    }
}
```

### **Checkpoint Question:**
- Can an overriding method change the return type of the method it overrides? If so, how?

## **3. Runtime Polymorphism (10 minutes)**

### **Understanding Polymorphism:**
Method overriding is the backbone of runtime polymorphism in Java. When a method is called on an object, the JVM determines which method to execute based on the actual object type, not the reference type.

### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent's show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child's show()");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Parent obj = new Child();
        obj.show();  // Outputs: Child's show()
    }
}
```

### **Edge Case - Overriding vs. Hiding:**
- **Static Methods**: If a subclass defines a static method with the same name and signature as a static method in the superclass, the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass rather than overriding it.

### **Checkpoint Question:**
- What is runtime polymorphism, and how does method overriding facilitate it?

## **4. Exceptions in Method Overriding (10 minutes)**

### **Rules for Exception Handling:**
- The overriding method must not throw broader checked exceptions than the method it overrides.

### **Example with Exceptions:**
```java
class Parent {
    void show() throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Parent's show()");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() throws FileNotFoundException {  // Subclass exception
        System.out.println("Child's show()");
    }
}
```

### **Edge Case:**
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: Unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException`) can be thrown by the overriding method even if they are not declared in the overridden method.

### **Checkpoint Question:**
- Can an overriding method throw a different exception than the overridden method? Explain with an example.

## **5. Coding Exercises (15 minutes)**

### **Exercise 1: Basic Method Overriding**
Create a superclass `Vehicle` with a method `move()`. Create subclasses `Car` and `Bicycle` that override the `move()` method. Create instances and demonstrate method overriding.

### **Exercise 2: Covariant Return Types**
Design a class hierarchy where a parent class has a method with a non-primitive return type. Override this method in the subclass with a covariant return type.

### **Exercise 3: Overriding with Exception Handling**
Create a superclass `BankAccount` with a method `withdraw()` that throws an exception. Override this method in a subclass `SavingsAccount` with a more specific exception.
