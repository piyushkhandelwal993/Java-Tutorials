### Topic: Final Keyword in Java

#### **Introduction**
The `final` keyword in Java is used to define constants, prevent inheritance, and restrict method overriding. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes, each serving a different purpose. Understanding how to use `final` is crucial for controlling and maintaining code behavior, particularly in large applications.

#### **1. Final Variables**
When a variable is declared as `final`, its value cannot be changed once initialized. This makes it a constant.

##### **Example:**
```java
public class FinalVariableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int MAX_VALUE = 100;
        MAX_VALUE = 200; // Compilation Error: Cannot assign a value to a final variable
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**
- The variable `MAX_VALUE` is declared as `final`, meaning it can only be assigned once. Any attempt to change its value later will result in a compilation error.

##### **Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts:**
- **Blank Final Variable:** A final variable can be declared without initialization, but it must be initialized in the constructor.
- **Final Static Variables:** These are constants shared across all instances of a class, and they must be initialized at the time of declaration or in a static block.

##### **Example:**
```java
public class FinalVariableExample {
    final int BLANK_FINAL;
    static final int STATIC_FINAL;

    static {
        STATIC_FINAL = 50;
    }

    public FinalVariableExample(int value) {
        BLANK_FINAL = value;
    }
}
```

#### **Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `final` keyword when applied to a variable?
2. Can a `final` variable be initialized after declaration? Explain with an example.
3. What is the difference between a final instance variable and a final static variable?

#### **2. Final Methods**
A method declared as `final` cannot be overridden by subclasses. This ensures that the method's behavior remains consistent across all subclasses.

##### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    final void show() {
        System.out.println("This is a final method.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { // Compilation Error: Cannot override the final method from Parent
        System.out.println("Attempting to override a final method.");
    }
}
```
**Explanation:**
- The `show()` method in the `Parent` class is marked as `final`, so the `Child` class cannot override it. This guarantees that the method's implementation remains unchanged in any subclass.

##### **Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts:**
- **Private Final Methods:** A private method is implicitly final because it cannot be overridden by subclasses. However, declaring a private method as final is redundant.
- **Inheritance with Final Methods:** If a method is marked final in a superclass, all subclasses must use that exact implementation, which can be restrictive in certain design patterns.

##### **Example:**
```java
class Base {
    private final void display() {
        System.out.println("Base display");
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    private void display() { // No error, but it's not an override
        System.out.println("Derived display");
    }
}
```

#### **Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What happens when you attempt to override a final method?
2. Is there any difference between a private final method and a private method?
3. How does the final method concept relate to the Liskov Substitution Principle?

#### **3. Final Classes**
A class declared as `final` cannot be extended. This is useful when creating immutable classes or when you want to prevent inheritance for security or design reasons.

##### **Example:**
```java
final class FinalClass {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is a final class.");
    }
}

class SubClass extends FinalClass { // Compilation Error: Cannot inherit from final class
}
```
**Explanation:**
- The `FinalClass` cannot be extended by any other class. This ensures that its behavior is locked and can't be altered through inheritance.

##### **Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts:**
- **Immutable Classes:** Immutable classes often use the final keyword to ensure that the class cannot be subclassed, which would potentially compromise its immutability.
- **Final Class vs Final Method:** While a final method restricts behavior in one method, a final class restricts all methods from being overridden or extended.

##### **Example:**
```java
final class ImmutableClass {
    private final int value;

    ImmutableClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

#### **Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Why would you declare a class as final?
2. What are the implications of making a class final on its design and flexibility?
3. Can a final class have final methods? What would be the effect?

### **Coding Exercises:**

1. **Final Variables:**
   - Create a class `Constants` that contains final static variables for mathematical constants like PI, E, etc. Try to reassign these constants and observe the results.

2. **Final Methods:**
   - Design a class `Vehicle` with a final method `engineType()`. Then create a subclass `Car` and try to override the `engineType()` method. Analyze the compilation errors.

3. **Final Classes:**
   - Write a final class `Currency` with methods to get and set currency values. Attempt to extend this class and observe the behavior.

### **Post-Lecture Questions:**

1. Explain the use of the final keyword in Java with respect to variables, methods, and classes. Provide examples where each would be appropriately used.
2. How does using final in Java help with immutability? Give a detailed explanation.
3. What are the consequences of using final on method design in object-oriented programming? Discuss how this might affect subclassing and design patterns like the Template Method.
