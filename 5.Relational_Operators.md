### **Lecture Plan: Relational Operators in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Relational Operators**

**Definition:**  
Relational operators in Java are used to compare two values. The result of a relational operation is a boolean value, either `true` or `false`.

**List of Relational Operators:**
- **`==` (Equal to):** Checks if two values are equal.
- **`!=` (Not equal to):** Checks if two values are not equal.
- **`>` (Greater than):** Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
- **`<` (Less than):** Checks if the left value is less than the right.
- **`>=` (Greater than or equal to):** Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
- **`<=` (Less than or equal to):** Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;

System.out.println(a == b); // false
System.out.println(a != b); // true
System.out.println(a > b);  // false
System.out.println(a < b);  // true
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of relational operators in Java?
2. How does the `==` operator differ from the `!=` operator?
3. What is the result of the expression `7 >= 7`?

#### **2. Using Relational Operators in Conditional Statements**

**Conditional Statements:**
Relational operators are commonly used in conditional statements like `if`, `while`, `for`, and `do-while`.

**Example:**
```java
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Comparing Floating-point Numbers:** Be cautious when comparing floating-point numbers due to precision issues.
  - Example: `double x = 0.1 * 3; double y = 0.3; System.out.println(x == y); // might return false`
- **Comparing Objects:** Using `==` with objects checks reference equality, not value equality.
  - Example:
    ```java
    String s1 = new String("Hello");
    String s2 = new String("Hello");
    System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false
    System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What happens if you use `==` to compare two different object references with the same content?
2. Why should you be careful when comparing floating-point numbers?
3. What is the outcome of using `<=` in a `for` loop?

#### **3. Relational Operators with Primitive Types**

**Primitive Types:**
Relational operators can be used with all primitive data types except `boolean`.

**Example:**
```java
char letterA = 'A';
char letterB = 'B';

System.out.println(letterA < letterB); // true
```

**Tricky Concept:**
- **Character Comparison:** Characters are compared based on their Unicode values.
  - Example: `'A' < 'B'` returns `true` because the Unicode value of 'A' is less than that of 'B'.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Can relational operators be used with all primitive types?
2. How does character comparison work in Java?
3. What will be the result of comparing two different `char` values?

#### **4. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a Java program that compares two integers using all relational operators. Display the results of each comparison.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that takes three floating-point numbers as input and determines if they are equal using relational operators. Discuss any precision issues encountered.

**Exercise 3:**  
Write a program that uses relational operators to compare the ages of three people and prints the oldest and youngest person.

#### **5. Edge Cases, Tricky Concepts, and Exceptions**

**Comparing Wrapper Classes:**
- **Issue:** When comparing wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, etc., using `==` checks reference equality, not value equality.
  - Example:
    ```java
    Integer num1 = 128;
    Integer num2 = 128;
    System.out.println(num1 == num2); // false
    ```

**Precision in Floating-point Comparison:**
- **Issue:** Comparing floating-point numbers directly might lead to unexpected results due to precision limitations.
  - Solution: Consider using a tolerance value for comparison.
  - Example:
    ```java
    double x = 0.1 * 7;
    double y = 0.7;
    System.out.println(Math.abs(x - y) < 0.0001); // true
    ```

**Comparing Characters:**
- **Issue:** Comparing characters might produce unexpected results if the developer is unaware of Unicode values.
  - Example: `'A' > 'a'` returns `false` because the Unicode value of 'A' is less than 'a'.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Why does `Integer num1 = 128; Integer num2 = 128;` return `false` when compared with `==`?
2. How can you accurately compare floating-point numbers in Java?
3. Why does the comparison `'A' > 'a'` return `false`?

#### **6. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. What are relational operators used for in Java?
2. Explain why comparing two floating-point numbers directly might lead to unexpected results.
3. Write a program that compares two `Integer` objects and explains the result when using `==` versus `.equals()`.
4. Discuss a scenario where using relational operators with characters could lead to confusion. How can you resolve it?
