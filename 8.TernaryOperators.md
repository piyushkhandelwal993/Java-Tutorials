### **Lecture Plan: Ternary Operators in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Ternary Operators**

**Definition:**  
The ternary operator in Java is a concise way to perform conditional operations. Itâ€™s a shorthand for the `if-else` statement and is represented by the `? :` syntax.

**Syntax:**  
```java
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
- **condition:** The expression to evaluate, which must return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **expression1:** Executed if the condition is `true`.
- **expression2:** Executed if the condition is `false`.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10, b = 20;
int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // max will be 20
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the ternary operator in Java?
2. How does the ternary operator differ from the `if-else` statement?
3. Write the syntax of a ternary operator.

#### **2. Detailed Explanation and Use Cases**

**Basic Usage:**  
Ternary operators are often used to simplify the code by reducing multiple lines of `if-else` statements into a single line.

**Example:**
```java
String result = (score > 50) ? "Pass" : "Fail";
```

**Nested Ternary Operators:**  
Ternary operators can be nested, but this should be done with caution, as it can make the code difficult to read.

**Example:**
```java
int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30;
int max = (x > y) ? (x > z ? x : z) : (y > z ? y : z); // max will be 30
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. When should you prefer a ternary operator over an `if-else` statement?
2. How would you write a nested ternary operator?
3. Can ternary operators be used to assign values to variables? If so, how?

#### **3. Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts**

**Type Compatibility:**  
The expressions in a ternary operator must either be of the same type or one must be convertible to the other.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 5;
String result = (a > 0) ? "Positive" : "Negative"; // Valid
String invalid = (a > 0) ? "Positive" : 0; // Compilation error
```

**Avoiding Complexity:**  
Nested ternary operators can become difficult to read and maintain. In such cases, it might be better to use traditional `if-else` statements.

**Misleading Code:**  
Overusing the ternary operator can make the code less readable, especially when the condition or expressions are complex.

**Example:**
```java
int result = (a > b) ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c); // Complex and hard to read
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What types of values can be returned by a ternary operator?
2. Explain the potential pitfalls of using nested ternary operators.
3. Why is it important to consider code readability when using ternary operators?

#### **4. Exception Handling with Ternary Operators**

**Handling Null Values:**  
Ternary operators can be used to handle potential `null` values and prevent `NullPointerException`.

**Example:**
```java
String name = null;
String displayName = (name != null) ? name : "Unknown";
```

**Avoiding NullPointerException:**  
The ternary operator can be a useful tool in defensive programming by ensuring that potentially `null` values are handled appropriately.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How can ternary operators be used to handle `null` values?
2. What are the risks of not handling `null` values properly in ternary expressions?
3. Provide an example where a ternary operator can prevent a `NullPointerException`.

#### **5. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd using the ternary operator.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that finds the maximum of three numbers using nested ternary operators.

**Exercise 3:**  
Implement a ternary operator to assign a default value to a string if it is `null`. Discuss the importance of this in preventing `NullPointerException`.

#### **6. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the syntax of a ternary operator and provide a simple example.
2. Why might nested ternary operators be considered less readable than `if-else` statements?
3. Provide a scenario where using a ternary operator is more beneficial than using an `if-else` statement.
4. Write a code snippet where the ternary operator is used to handle potential `null` values.
