### **1. Introduction to the `super` Keyword**

The `super` keyword in Java is used to refer to the immediate parent class object. It is primarily used in three contexts:

1. **Accessing parent class variables:** When a child class and its parent class have a variable with the same name, `super` can be used to access the variable from the parent class.
2. **Invoking parent class methods:** When a child class overrides a method from the parent class, `super` can be used to invoke the parent class method.
3. **Calling parent class constructors:** `super()` is used to call the parent class constructor from the child class constructor.

### **2. Using `super` to Access Parent Class Variables**

When a parent and child class have a variable with the same name, the variable in the child class shadows the one in the parent class. The `super` keyword allows you to access the parent class variable.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    String name = "Parent";
}

class Child extends Parent {
    String name = "Child";

    void printNames() {
        System.out.println("Child name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Parent name: " + super.name);
    }
}

public class SuperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        child.printNames();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `super.name` refers to the `name` variable in the `Parent` class.
- `name` (without `super`) refers to the `name` variable in the `Child` class.

**Output:**
```
Child name: Child
Parent name: Parent
```

### **3. Using `super` to Invoke Parent Class Methods**

When a child class overrides a method of the parent class, `super.methodName()` can be used to call the method from the parent class.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method in Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Display method in Child class");
    }

    void show() {
        super.display();
        display();
    }
}

public class SuperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
        child.show();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `super.display()` calls the `display` method from the `Parent` class.
- `display()` (without `super`) calls the `display` method from the `Child` class.

**Output:**
```
Display method in Parent class
Display method in Child class
```

### **4. Using `super()` to Call Parent Class Constructors**

The `super()` keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class. If the parent class has a parameterized constructor, `super()` can pass arguments to it.

#### **Example:**
```java
class Parent {
    Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent class constructor");
    }

    Parent(String message) {
        System.out.println("Parent constructor with message: " + message);
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super("Hello from Child");
        System.out.println("Child class constructor");
    }
}

public class SuperExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Child child = new Child();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `super("Hello from Child")` calls the parameterized constructor of the `Parent` class with the argument `"Hello from Child"`.

**Output:**
```
Parent constructor with message: Hello from Child
Child class constructor
```

### **5. Edge Cases and Tricky Concepts**

1. **Order of Constructor Calls:**
   - If you do not explicitly call a parent class constructor using `super()`, the compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the parent class.
   - If the parent class does not have a no-argument constructor and you don’t call another constructor using `super()`, a compile-time error occurs.

2. **Overriding Methods:**
   - If a method in the child class does not override the parent method correctly (e.g., different method signature), calling `super.methodName()` will result in a compile-time error.

3. **Calling `super()` in Non-Constructor Contexts:**
   - `super()` cannot be used in static contexts (e.g., static methods) because it refers to instance-level behavior.

### **6. Coding Exercises**

#### **Exercise 1:**
Create a `Person` class with a constructor that takes a name and age. Create a `Student` class that extends `Person` and includes a grade attribute. Use `super()` to call the `Person` constructor from the `Student` constructor.

#### **Exercise 2:**
Override a method in a child class that calls a method from the parent class using `super.methodName()`. Ensure that the child method provides additional functionality on top of the parent method.

#### **Exercise 3:**
Create a class hierarchy with at least three levels (e.g., `Grandparent`, `Parent`, `Child`). Use `super` to access variables and methods at different levels and print them.

### **7. Checkpoint Questions**

1. What is the purpose of the `super` keyword in Java?
2. How do you use `super` to access a parent class method that has been overridden in the child class?
3. What happens if you don’t call `super()` in a child class constructor?

---

### **8. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain with an example how `super` can be used to access a parent class variable.
2. Write a program that demonstrates the use of `super()` in a multi-level inheritance hierarchy.
3. What errors can arise if `super` is used incorrectly in a constructor?
