### **Lecture Plan: Shift Operators in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Shift Operators**

**Definition:**  
Shift operators are used to shift the bits of a number left or right, effectively multiplying or dividing the number by powers of two. These operations are often used in low-level programming and are essential for understanding bitwise manipulation.

**Types of Shift Operators in Java:**
- **Left Shift (`<<`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by the specified number of positions. Each left shift multiplies the number by 2.
- **Right Shift (`>>`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by the specified number of positions. Each right shift divides the number by 2.
- **Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`):** Shifts the bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with zeros, regardless of the sign of the original number.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 8;  // 00001000 in binary
int b = a << 2; // Left shift by 2 positions, b = 32 (00100000 in binary)
int c = a >> 2; // Right shift by 2 positions, c = 2 (00000010 in binary)
int d = a >>> 2; // Unsigned right shift, d = 2 (00000010 in binary)
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What does the left shift operator (`<<`) do in Java?
2. How does the right shift operator (`>>`) differ from the unsigned right shift (`>>>`)?
3. What happens when you shift a negative number to the right using `>>>`?

#### **2. Detailed Explanation of Each Shift Operator**

**Left Shift (`<<`):**
- **Usage:** Used to multiply a number by powers of two.
- **Behavior:** Shifts all bits in the binary representation of the number to the left, filling the rightmost bits with zeros.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int x = 5;  // 00000101 in binary
  int result = x << 3; // 5 * 2^3 = 40 (00101000 in binary)
  ```

**Right Shift (`>>`):**
- **Usage:** Used to divide a number by powers of two while preserving the sign.
- **Behavior:** Shifts all bits in the binary representation of the number to the right, filling the leftmost bits with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers).
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int y = -16; // 11110000 in binary (for a 8-bit signed integer)
  int result = y >> 2; // -16 / 2^2 = -4 (11111100 in binary)
  ```

**Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`):**
- **Usage:** Used to divide a number by powers of two without preserving the sign.
- **Behavior:** Shifts all bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with zeros regardless of the sign of the original number.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int z = -16; // 11110000 in binary (for a 8-bit signed integer)
  int result = z >>> 2; // Result = 1073741820 (00111111111111111111111111111100 in 32-bit binary)
  ```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Overflow in Left Shift:**
  - Example: Shifting a large number can cause overflow, resulting in unexpected negative values.
    ```java
    int overflowExample = 1 << 31; // Result = -2147483648 (Overflow occurs)
    ```
- **Shifting Beyond Integer Size:**
  - Example: Shifting by more than 31 positions (for an `int`) has no additional effect.
    ```java
    int shiftBeyond = 1 << 35; // Same as 1 << 3 due to modulo operation
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What will be the result of shifting the number `5` to the left by 4 positions?
2. How does the `>>` operator handle the sign of a number?
3. What is the result of applying `>>>` to a negative number?

#### **3. Shift Operators with Different Data Types**

**Shift Operations on Different Data Types:**
- **Integer (`int`):** Most common use case; shifts operate within the 32-bit range.
- **Long (`long`):** Shift operations are similar to `int`, but within the 64-bit range.
- **Short (`short`) and Byte (`byte`):** Operate within the 16-bit and 8-bit ranges respectively, but are automatically promoted to `int` during the shift operation.

**Example:**
```java
short s = 1;
short result = (short) (s << 10); // Must cast back to short after shifting
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Sign Extension in Short and Byte:** Shifting on smaller data types like `short` and `byte` can result in unexpected sign extension when casting back.
  - Example:
    ```java
    byte b = -8;
    int shifted = b >> 2; // Result is 11111110 in binary
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How are shift operations handled on `short` and `byte` data types?
2. What is the result of shifting a `long` by more than 63 positions?
3. Why is it necessary to cast back to `short` or `byte` after shifting?

#### **4. Common Interview Questions and Tricky Concepts**

**Interview Tricky Concepts:**
- **Shift by Zero:** Understanding the effect of shifting by zero positions.
  - Example: `int x = 8; int y = x << 0; // y is still 8`
- **Using Shift Operators in Arithmetic Operations:**
  - Example: `int x = 10; int y = x << 1; // Equivalent to x * 2`
- **Shift Operators and Negative Numbers:**
  - Understanding the sign extension and the effect on unsigned shifts.

**Common Interview Questions:**
1. Explain the difference between `>>` and `>>>`.
2. How can you use shift operators to multiply or divide a number by powers of two?
3. What are the pitfalls of using shift operators with signed numbers?

#### **5. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a program to multiply a number by 8 using a shift operator. Explain why this method is efficient.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that shifts a negative number to the right using both `>>` and `>>>`. Compare and explain the results.

**Exercise 3:**  
Implement a program that counts the number of `1` bits in an integer using shift operators.
