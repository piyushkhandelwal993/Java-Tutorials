### **Lecture Plan: The `static` Keyword in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to the `static` Keyword**

**Definition:**  
The `static` keyword in Java is used for memory management, making variables or methods common to all instances of a class. This means that static members belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance.

**Use Cases:**
- **Static Variables:** Used for properties that should be shared among all instances of a class (e.g., a counter to keep track of the number of instances).
- **Static Methods:** Can be called without creating an instance of the class. Commonly used for utility or helper methods.
- **Static Blocks:** Used for static initialization of a class.

**Example:**
```java
class Example {
    static int counter = 0; // Static Variable

    static void incrementCounter() { // Static Method
        counter++;
    }

    static { // Static Block
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }
}
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What does the `static` keyword do in Java?
2. Can a static method access instance variables? Why or why not?
3. What is the purpose of a static block in Java?

#### **2. Static Variables**

**Explanation:**
- **Scope:** Static variables are class-level variables and are shared among all instances of the class.
- **Lifetime:** They are initialized when the class is loaded and destroyed when the program ends.
- **Memory:** Stored in the method area of memory, not in the heap.

**Example:**
```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Shared among all instances

    Counter() {
        count++;
        System.out.println("Count is: " + count);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
    }
}
```

**Edge Case:**
- **Static Variable Initialization:** If a static variable depends on an instance variable for its initialization, it can lead to unexpected results.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. When is a static variable initialized in Java?
2. Where are static variables stored in memory?
3. Explain what happens if you declare a static variable inside a method.

#### **3. Static Methods**

**Explanation:**
- **Accessing Static Variables:** Static methods can access other static members (variables and methods) directly but cannot access instance variables or methods directly.
- **Utility Methods:** Often used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of the class (e.g., `Math.pow()`).

**Example:**
```java
class Utility {
    static int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = Utility.square(5);
        System.out.println("Square of 5: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Tricky Concept:**
- **Overriding Static Methods:** Static methods cannot be overridden in the way instance methods can be. If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature, it hides the superclass method, rather than overriding it.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Can a static method in Java be overridden?
2. Why can't static methods access instance variables?
3. What are common use cases for static methods?

#### **4. Static Blocks**

**Explanation:**
- **Initialization Logic:** Static blocks are used to execute code when the class is first loaded. They are often used for initializing static variables or for executing code that needs to run before any object of the class is created.
- **Execution Order:** Static blocks are executed in the order they appear in the class, before any constructors are called.

**Example:**
```java
class Example {
    static int x;

    static {
        x = 10;
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value of x: " + Example.x);
    }
}
```

**Edge Case:**
- **Multiple Static Blocks:** If a class has multiple static blocks, they will be executed in the order they appear.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of a static block in Java?
2. Can you have more than one static block in a class? If so, in what order are they executed?
3. Why might you use a static block instead of initializing a static variable directly?

#### **5. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Create a class with a static variable that keeps track of how many objects of that class have been created. Write a program to test this functionality.

**Exercise 2:**  
Write a Java program that uses a static method to calculate and return the factorial of a number. Ensure that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class.

**Exercise 3:**  
Design a class with a static block that reads a configuration file (or some data from the user) and initializes static variables accordingly. Test the program by accessing these static variables in the main method.

#### **6. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the difference between a static variable and an instance variable in Java.
2. Why is it not possible to override static methods in Java? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.
3. Describe a scenario where a static block would be the best solution for initialization in a class.
4. Write a code snippet where multiple static blocks are used. Explain the order of execution.
