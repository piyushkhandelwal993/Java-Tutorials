### **Lecture Plan: Objects and Classes in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

**Definition:**  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of methods (also known as functions or procedures).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a type of object according to the data it holds and the operations it can perform.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It is a self-contained entity that consists of both data and methods to manipulate that data.

**Example:**
```java
class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car(); // Creating an object
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.model = "Toyota";
        myCar.startEngine(); // Calling a method on the object
    }
}
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is a class in Java?
2. How is an object related to a class?
3. Can a class exist without any objects? Explain.

#### **2. Understanding Classes in Java**

**Class Structure:**
- **Fields:** Variables that hold the state of an object.
- **Methods:** Functions that define the behavior of an object.
- **Constructors:** Special methods used to initialize objects.

**Example:**
```java
class Book {
    String title;
    String author;

    // Constructor
    Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
    }

    // Method
    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Title: " + title + ", Author: " + author);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book = new Book("1984", "George Orwell"); // Object creation
        book.displayInfo(); // Calling a method on the object
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Null Objects:** Attempting to call a method on an object that has not been initialized.
  - Example: `Book book = null; book.displayInfo(); // Throws NullPointerException`
- **Multiple Instances:** Different objects of the same class can hold different states.
  - Example: Two `Book` objects with different titles and authors.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of a constructor in a class?
2. How do you create an object in Java?
3. What happens if you try to access a method on a `null` object?

#### **3. Encapsulation in Java**

**Definition:**  
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the objectâ€™s components, which is why it's also known as data hiding.

**Access Modifiers:**
- **Private:** Accessible only within the same class.
- **Public:** Accessible from any other class.
- **Protected:** Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Default (no modifier):** Accessible within the same package.

**Example:**
```java
class Person {
    private String name; // Private field

    public String getName() { // Public method to access the private field
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Alice");
        System.out.println(person.getName());
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Encapsulation and Security:** Ensures that the internal state of an object can only be changed in controlled ways.
  - Example: Prevent direct modification of `name` without validation.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is encapsulation in Java?
2. Why are private fields commonly used in classes?
3. How does encapsulation improve code maintainability?

#### **4. Understanding `this` Keyword**

**Definition:**  
The `this` keyword in Java is a reference to the current object, used to differentiate between class fields and parameters with the same name.

**Example:**
```java
class Circle {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius; // Differentiates between the field and parameter
    }

    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius; // Uses this to reference the current object
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle circle = new Circle(5.0);
        System.out.println(circle.calculateArea());
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Method Chaining:** Using `this` to return the current object, enabling method chaining.
  - Example:
    ```java
    class Rectangle {
        int width, height;

        Rectangle setWidth(int width) {
            this.width = width;
            return this;
        }

        Rectangle setHeight(int height) {
            this.height = height;
            return this;
        }
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in Java?
2. Can `this` be used in static methods? Why or why not?
3. How does `this` help in method chaining?

#### **5. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Create a `Student` class with fields `name`, `rollNumber`, and `grade`. Include methods to set and get the values of these fields. Write a `Main` class to create objects of `Student` and display their information.

**Exercise 2:**  
Write a program to demonstrate method overloading in a class `Calculator`. Create multiple `add` methods to handle different types of parameters (e.g., `int`, `double`, etc.).

**Exercise 3:**  
Develop a `BankAccount` class with fields `accountNumber`, `balance`, and `accountHolderName`. Include methods to deposit and withdraw money. Make sure to handle edge cases like overdrawing from the account.

#### **6. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the relationship between a class and an object with an example.
2. How does encapsulation contribute to the principle of data hiding?
3. Provide an example where the `this` keyword is necessary in a constructor.
4. What could happen if you try to access a private field directly from outside the class? Why is this generally not allowed?
5. Write a code snippet that demonstrates the creation of multiple objects from the same class and how they can hold different states.
