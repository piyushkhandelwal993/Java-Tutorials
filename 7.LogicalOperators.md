### **Lecture Plan: Logical Operators in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Logical Operators**

**Definition:**
Logical operators in Java are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions. They return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) and are essential for controlling the flow of a program, particularly in decision-making statements like `if`, `while`, and `for` loops.

**Types of Logical Operators:**
- **AND (`&&`)**
- **OR (`||`)**
- **NOT (`!`)**

**Example:**
```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
System.out.println(a && b); // false
System.out.println(a || b); // true
System.out.println(!a);     // false
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What are logical operators in Java?
2. How does the AND (`&&`) operator work in a boolean expression?
3. What is the result of `!true`?

#### **2. Understanding AND (`&&`) Operator**

**Behavior:**
- The AND operator (`&&`) returns `true` only if both operands are `true`. If either operand is `false`, the result is `false`.
- **Short-circuiting:** If the first operand is `false`, the second operand is not evaluated, as the result will inevitably be `false`.

**Example:**
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
System.out.println((x < 15) && (y > 15)); // true
System.out.println((x > 15) && (y > 15)); // false
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Short-circuit behavior:**
  - Example:
    ```java
    boolean result = (x > 15) && (y++ > 15);
    System.out.println(y); // y remains unchanged if (x > 15) is false
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Explain the behavior of the AND operator when one of the operands is `false`.
2. What is short-circuiting in logical operations?
3. How does short-circuiting affect the performance of a program?

#### **3. Understanding OR (`||`) Operator**

**Behavior:**
- The OR operator (`||`) returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`. If both operands are `false`, the result is `false`.
- **Short-circuiting:** If the first operand is `true`, the second operand is not evaluated, as the result will be `true` regardless.

**Example:**
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
System.out.println((x < 15) || (y > 15)); // true
System.out.println((x > 15) || (y > 25)); // false
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Short-circuit behavior:**
  - Example:
    ```java
    boolean result = (x < 15) || (y++ > 15);
    System.out.println(y); // y remains unchanged if (x < 15) is true
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How does the OR operator differ from the AND operator?
2. What happens if the first operand in an OR operation is `true`?
3. Can the OR operator be used to avoid `NullPointerException`? How?

#### **4. Understanding NOT (`!`) Operator**

**Behavior:**
- The NOT operator (`!`) inverts the boolean value of its operand. If the operand is `true`, the result is `false`, and vice versa.

**Example:**
```java
boolean isTrue = true;
System.out.println(!isTrue); // false

boolean isFalse = false;
System.out.println(!isFalse); // true
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Double Negation:** Applying the NOT operator twice will revert to the original value.
  - Example:
    ```java
    boolean isTrue = true;
    System.out.println(!!isTrue); // true
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the result of applying the NOT operator to a `true` value?
2. How does double negation work with the NOT operator?
3. Can the NOT operator be used to toggle boolean values? Give an example.

#### **5. Combining Logical Operators**

**Combining AND, OR, and NOT:**
- Logical operators can be combined to form complex boolean expressions.
- Precedence: `!` has the highest precedence, followed by `&&`, and then `||`. Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence.

**Example:**
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int z = 30;
System.out.println((x < y) && (y < z) || !(x == 10)); // true
```

**Tricky Concepts:**
- **Operator Precedence:** Understanding the order of evaluation is crucial for correctly interpreting complex expressions.
  - Example:
    ```java
    boolean result = !true && false || true; // evaluates to true
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the order of precedence for logical operators in Java?
2. How can parentheses be used to control the evaluation order in logical expressions?
3. Provide an example of a complex boolean expression using all three logical operators.

#### **6. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a program to determine if a number is within a specific range (e.g., 10 to 20) using logical operators.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that simulates a simple login system where the user must input the correct username and password to gain access. Use logical operators to handle the conditions.

**Exercise 3:**  
Develop a program that checks if a year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. Implement this using logical operators.

#### **7. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. What is the difference between `&&` and `||` in terms of their operation and short-circuit behavior?
2. How can logical operators be used to simplify conditional statements in Java?
3. Write a program that uses logical operators to check if a number is both positive and even. Explain your approach.
4. What happens if you use the NOT operator on a `null` boolean reference? How can you avoid such exceptions?
