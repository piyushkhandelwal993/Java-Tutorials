### **Lecture Plan: Arithmetic Operators in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Arithmetic Operators**

**Definition:**
Arithmetic operators in Java are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

**List of Arithmetic Operators:**
- **Addition (`+`):** Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (`/`):** Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (`%`):** Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

int sum = a + b; // 15
int diff = a - b; // 5
int product = a * b; // 50
int quotient = a / b; // 2
int remainder = a % b; // 0
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. List all the arithmetic operators in Java.
2. What is the difference between the `+` operator and the `%` operator?
3. What is the result of `10 / 3` in Java?

#### **2. Order of Operations (Operator Precedence)**

**Definition:**
Java follows a specific order of operations, known as operator precedence, which determines the sequence in which operators are evaluated in an expression.

**Operator Precedence in Java:**
1. **Parentheses (`()`):** Highest precedence.
2. **Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulus (`%`):** Evaluated before addition and subtraction.
3. **Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`):** Lower precedence.

**Example:**
```java
int result = 10 + 5 * 2; // result is 20, not 30
int resultWithParentheses = (10 + 5) * 2; // result is 30
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Integer Division:**
  - Division between two integers results in an integer, discarding any fractional part.
  - Example: `int result = 10 / 4; // result is 2, not 2.5`

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is operator precedence, and why is it important?
2. Explain the result of `10 + 5 * 2` in Java.
3. How can you modify the expression to change the order of operations?

#### **3. Integer Division and Floating-Point Arithmetic**

**Integer Division:**
When both operands are integers, Java performs integer division, where any fractional part is discarded.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10;
int b = 4;
int result = a / b; // result is 2, not 2.5
```

**Floating-Point Division:**
If one or both operands are floating-point types (`float`, `double`), the division result will be a floating-point number.

**Example:**
```java
double result = 10.0 / 4; // result is 2.5
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Division by Zero:**
  - **Integer Division:** Throws `ArithmeticException`.
    - Example: `int result = 10 / 0; // Throws ArithmeticException`
  - **Floating-Point Division:** Results in `Infinity` or `NaN` (Not a Number).
    - Example: `double result = 10.0 / 0; // result is Infinity`

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What happens when you divide an integer by zero in Java?
2. Explain the difference between integer division and floating-point division.
3. What is the result of dividing a double by zero?

#### **4. Modulus Operator and Its Use Cases**

**Definition:**
The modulus operator (`%`) returns the remainder of a division operation. Itâ€™s often used to determine whether a number is even or odd, among other use cases.

**Example:**
```java
int remainder = 10 % 3; // remainder is 1
```

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Checking for Even or Odd:**
  - Example: `int number = 10; boolean isEven = number % 2 == 0;`
- **Cycling Through a Range:**
  - Example: `int index = (currentIndex + 1) % maxSize;`

**Edge Cases:**
- **Negative Operands:**
  - The result of the modulus operation can vary depending on the sign of the operands.
  - Example: `int result = -10 % 3; // result is -1`

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What does the modulus operator do?
2. How can you use the modulus operator to check if a number is even?
3. What is the result of `-10 % 3` in Java?

#### **5. Increment and Decrement Operators**

**Definition:**
The increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators are shorthand for adding or subtracting 1 from a variable.

**Types:**
- **Pre-Increment/Decrement (`++a`, `--a`):** Increases or decreases the value before the expression is evaluated.
- **Post-Increment/Decrement (`a++`, `a--`):** Increases or decreases the value after the expression is evaluated.

**Example:**
```java
int a = 10;
int b = ++a; // Pre-increment: a is now 11, b is 11

int x = 10;
int y = x++; // Post-increment: x is now 11, y is 10
```

**Tricky Concept:**
- **Difference Between Pre and Post Increment/Decrement:**
  - Example:
    ```java
    int a = 5;
    int b = a++ + a++; // b is 11, a is 7
    int c = ++a + ++a; // c is 13, a is 7
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the difference between `++a` and `a++`?
2. What will be the output of the following code: `int a = 5; int b = ++a + a++;`?
3. Explain the use of the decrement operator.

#### **6. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**
Write a program to calculate the average of three integers using arithmetic operators. Consider cases where one or more numbers might be negative.

**Exercise 2:**
Create a program that uses the modulus operator to print all odd numbers between 1 and 100.

**Exercise 3:**
Develop a calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handle edge cases like division by zero and floating-point precision.

#### **7. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the concept of integer division and how it differs from floating-point division.
2. How does operator precedence affect the outcome of expressions involving multiple operators?
3. Write a code snippet to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using arithmetic operators.
4. Describe a scenario where the modulus operator can be particularly useful.
5. Provide an example where using the pre-increment and post-increment operators leads to different results.
