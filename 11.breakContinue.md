### **Lecture Plan: Break, Continue, Exit in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Control Flow Statements**

**Definition:**  
Control flow statements alter the sequence of execution in a program. In Java, `break`, `continue`, and `return` (for exiting) are commonly used to manage control flow in loops and switch statements.

**Overview:**
- **`break`:** Exits from the loop or switch statement.
- **`continue`:** Skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.
- **`return`:** Exits from the current method and optionally returns a value.

**Example of Basic Usage:**
```java
public class ControlFlowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (i == 2) {
                break; // Exit loop when i is 2
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What does the `break` statement do in a loop?
2. How does the `continue` statement affect loop execution?
3. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a method?

#### **2. Using `break` Statement**

**Definition:**  
The `break` statement is used to exit from a loop or switch case prematurely. It can be used to stop further execution of code inside the loop or switch block.

**Usage in Loops:**
- **For Loop:** Exits from the loop when a condition is met.
- **While Loop:** Terminates the loop early based on a condition.
- **Do-While Loop:** Similar usage to `for` and `while` loops.

**Example:**
```java
public class BreakExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        for (int num : numbers) {
            if (num == 3) {
                break; // Exits loop when num is 3
            }
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Nested Loops:** The `break` statement only exits the innermost loop. To break out of multiple nested loops, use labeled `break`.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    outerLoop:
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            if (i == 1 && j == 1) {
                break outerLoop; // Breaks out of both loops
            }
            System.out.println(i + " " + j);
        }
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How does `break` affect nested loops?
2. Can `break` be used in a `switch` statement? If so, how?
3. What is the difference between `break` and `return` statements?

#### **3. Using `continue` Statement**

**Definition:**  
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration. It does not exit the loop entirely.

**Usage in Loops:**
- **For Loop:** Skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next loop iteration.
- **While Loop:** Similar usage to `for` loop.
- **Do-While Loop:** Continues to the next iteration after skipping code.

**Example:**
```java
public class ContinueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            if (i == 2) {
                continue; // Skip printing when i is 2
            }
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Infinite Loops:** Ensure the `continue` statement does not lead to an infinite loop if conditions are not handled properly.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        i++;
        if (i == 3) {
            continue; // Skips printing 3
        }
        System.out.println(i);
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How does the `continue` statement differ from the `break` statement?
2. Can `continue` be used in a `switch` statement? If not, why?
3. What could go wrong if `continue` is used incorrectly in a loop?

#### **4. Exiting Methods with `return`**

**Definition:**  
The `return` statement exits a method and optionally returns a value. It can be used to terminate the execution of a method and pass control back to the caller.

**Usage in Methods:**
- **Returning Values:** Methods with a return type use `return` to provide a result.
- **Void Methods:** `return` can be used without a value to exit the method early.

**Example:**
```java
public class ReturnExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = addNumbers(5, 10);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Returns the sum of a and b
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Early Return:** Methods can exit early using `return`, which might affect control flow.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    public static void checkNumber(int number) {
        if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Negative number");
            return; // Exits the method early
        }
        System.out.println("Non-negative number");
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What happens when `return` is used in a method with a `void` return type?
2. How does `return` interact with the flow of a method's execution?
3. Can `return` be used in a loop? If so, how does it affect the loop?

#### **5. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a program that uses a loop to find the first number greater than 50 that is divisible by both 5 and 7. Use the `break` statement to exit the loop once the number is found.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips numbers that are multiples of 3 using the `continue` statement.

**Exercise 3:**  
Write a method that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop. Use the `return` statement to exit the method and return the result. Include checks to handle cases where the input number is negative.
