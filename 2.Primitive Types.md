### **Lecture Plan: Primitive Data Types in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Primitive Data Types**

**Definition:**
Primitive data types in Java are the most basic data types. They are predefined by the language and named by a reserved keyword. These types serve as the building blocks for data manipulation in Java.

**Categories:**
- **Integer Types:** `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
- **Floating-point Types:** `float`, `double`
- **Character Type:** `char`
- **Boolean Type:** `boolean`

**Importance:**
Understanding primitive data types is fundamental to mastering Java, as they are used in virtually every program.

**Example:**
```java
int age = 30; // Integer type
double temperature = 36.5; // Floating-point type
char grade = 'A'; // Character type
boolean isJavaFun = true; // Boolean type
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What are primitive data types in Java?
2. How many primitive data types does Java support?
3. Give an example of each category of primitive data types.

#### **2. Detailed Explanation of Each Primitive Data Type**

**2.1 Integer Types:**

- **byte:**
  - **Size:** 8-bit
  - **Range:** -128 to 127
  - **Use Case:** Saves memory in large arrays.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    byte smallNumber = 100;
    ```

- **short:**
  - **Size:** 16-bit
  - **Range:** -32,768 to 32,767
  - **Use Case:** Similar to `byte`, but allows larger values.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    short mediumNumber = 20000;
    ```

- **int:**
  - **Size:** 32-bit
  - **Range:** -2^31 to 2^31-1
  - **Use Case:** Most commonly used integer type.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    int largeNumber = 1000000;
    ```

- **long:**
  - **Size:** 64-bit
  - **Range:** -2^63 to 2^63-1
  - **Use Case:** When `int` is not large enough.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    long veryLargeNumber = 1000000000000L;
    ```

**Edge Case:**
- **Overflow:** Assigning a value beyond the range results in overflow.
  - Example:
    ```java
    byte b = 127;
    b++; // b becomes -128
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the range of the `byte` data type?
2. When would you use `long` instead of `int`?
3. What happens if you assign a value outside the range of `byte`?

**2.2 Floating-Point Types:**

- **float:**
  - **Size:** 32-bit
  - **Precision:** Approximately 7 decimal digits
  - **Use Case:** Single-precision floating-point operations.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    float pi = 3.14f;
    ```

- **double:**
  - **Size:** 64-bit
  - **Precision:** Approximately 15 decimal digits
  - **Use Case:** Double-precision floating-point operations, default for decimal values.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    double e = 2.718281828459045;
    ```

**Edge Case:**
- **Precision Loss:** Repeated arithmetic operations may result in precision loss.
  - Example:
    ```java
    System.out.println(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3); // prints false
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the difference between `float` and `double`?
2. Why do we use `float` instead of `double` in some cases?
3. How does precision loss occur in floating-point operations?

**2.3 Character Type:**

- **char:**
  - **Size:** 16-bit
  - **Range:** 0 to 65,535 (Unsigned Unicode characters)
  - **Use Case:** Stores single characters.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    char letter = 'A';
    ```

**Edge Case:**
- **Unicode Values:** `char` can hold any Unicode character, not just ASCII.
  - Example:
    ```java
    char smiley = '\u263A'; // â˜º
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the range of the `char` data type?
2. How is a `char` different from a `byte` or `int`?
3. Can `char` store numeric values? Explain.

**2.4 Boolean Type:**

- **boolean:**
  - **Size:** Not precisely defined (typically 1 bit or 1 byte)
  - **Values:** `true` or `false`
  - **Use Case:** Conditional logic.
  - **Example:**
    ```java
    boolean isRaining = false;
    ```

**Edge Case:**
- **Conditional Statements:** Boolean values directly influence control flow.
  - Example:
    ```java
    if (isRaining) {
        System.out.println("Take an umbrella.");
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What are the possible values for the `boolean` data type?
2. Why is `boolean` crucial in control flow statements?
3. What would be the output if `boolean isRaining = true;`?

#### **3. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**
Create a program that defines and initializes each primitive data type, prints their values, and explores the impact of overflow in integer types.

**Exercise 2:**
Write a program that takes a floating-point number as input and demonstrates the precision loss in repeated arithmetic operations. Compare the results using `float` and `double`.

**Exercise 3:**
Develop a small application that uses `char` to display Unicode characters for a given range. Extend it to include conditional logic using `boolean` values.

#### **4. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the difference between the `int` and `long` data types. When would you use one over the other?
2. What are the implications of precision loss in floating-point calculations? Provide a real-world example.
3. How does the `char` data type differ from `String` in Java? Can `char` hold more than one character?
4. Discuss how boolean expressions influence control flow in Java. Provide a code example.
