### **Lecture Plan: Constructors in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Constructors**

**Definition:**  
A constructor in Java is a special type of method used to initialize objects. Unlike methods, constructors are invoked automatically when an object of a class is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type, not even `void`.

**Types of Constructors:**
- **Default Constructor:** Automatically provided by Java if no constructors are defined. It initializes objects with default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor:** Allows initialization of objects with specific values.
- **Copy Constructor (Not native to Java):** Java doesn't have a built-in copy constructor like C++, but it can be simulated by using a constructor that takes an object of the same class as a parameter.

**Example:**
```java
class Example {
    int x;

    // Default Constructor
    Example() {
        x = 10;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Example(int val) {
        x = val;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example(); // Calls Default Constructor
        Example obj2 = new Example(20); // Calls Parameterized Constructor
    }
}
```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is a constructor in Java?
2. How does a constructor differ from a regular method?
3. When is a default constructor provided by Java?

#### **2. Constructor Overloading**

**Definition:**  
Constructor overloading is the process of defining multiple constructors in a class, each with a different parameter list. This allows objects to be initialized in different ways.

**Example:**
```java
class Rectangle {
    int width, height;

    // Default Constructor
    Rectangle() {
        width = height = 0;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    Rectangle(int w, int h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor with one parameter
    Rectangle(int side) {
        width = height = side;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Ambiguity in Overloading:** When overloaded constructors have parameter types that could lead to ambiguity, such as a constructor taking `int` and another taking `Integer`.
  - Example: `Rectangle(int w, Integer h);` and `Rectangle(Integer w, int h);` can cause confusion.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is constructor overloading?
2. How does the Java compiler differentiate between overloaded constructors?
3. What could cause ambiguity in constructor overloading?

#### **3. The Role of `this` Keyword in Constructors**

**Definition:**  
The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class. It is used to:
- Differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.
- Call one constructor from another within the same class (constructor chaining).

**Example:**
```java
class Point {
    int x, y;

    // Constructor using 'this' keyword
    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    // Constructor chaining
    Point() {
        this(0, 0); // Calls the parameterized constructor
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Recursive Constructor Invocation:** Using `this()` to call another constructor within the same class can lead to infinite recursion if not properly handled.
  - Example:
    ```java
    class Test {
        Test() {
            this(10); // Calls parameterized constructor
        }

        Test(int x) {
            this(); // Causes infinite recursion leading to StackOverflowError
        }
    }
    ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in constructors?
2. How does constructor chaining work in Java?
3. What error might occur if `this()` is misused in constructor chaining?

#### **4. Private Constructors and Singleton Design Pattern**

**Definition:**  
A private constructor is used to restrict the instantiation of a class. It is typically used in the Singleton Design Pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

**Example:**
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton singleInstance = null;

    // Private Constructor
    private Singleton() {}

    // Static method to provide global point of access
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (singleInstance == null) {
            singleInstance = new Singleton();
        }
        return singleInstance;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Reflection and Singleton:** Using Java Reflection API, the private constructor can be accessed, which can break the Singleton pattern.
  - Solution: Use an enum type to implement Singleton or throw an exception from the constructor if reflection is detected.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Why would you make a constructor private?
2. How does the Singleton pattern utilize a private constructor?
3. How can the Singleton pattern be compromised using reflection?

#### **5. Constructor Exceptions**

**Concept:**  
Constructors can throw exceptions, just like methods. However, if an exception is thrown in a constructor, the object creation is incomplete, and the object is not created.

**Example:**
```java
class Test {
    Test(int val) throws Exception {
        if (val < 0) {
            throw new Exception("Negative value not allowed");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Test t = new Test(-1); // Throws Exception
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- **Partial Object Construction:** If an exception is thrown during the execution of a constructor, the object is not fully created, which might leave the program in an unstable state.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. Can constructors throw exceptions in Java?
2. What happens if an exception is thrown during object creation?
3. How can you handle exceptions in constructors?

#### **6. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a class `Student` with instance variables `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Implement overloaded constructors to initialize these variables in different ways (default, partial, and full initialization). Discuss how the `this` keyword can be used in this scenario.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a `BankAccount` class with instance variables `accountNumber` and `balance`. Implement a constructor that throws an exception if the initial balance is less than zero. Write a test program to handle this exception.

**Exercise 3:**  
Design a `Shape` class with a private constructor and implement a Singleton design pattern for this class. Ensure that only one instance of the `Shape` class can be created.
