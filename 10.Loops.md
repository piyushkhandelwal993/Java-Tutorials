### **Lecture Plan: Loops in Java**

#### **1. Introduction to Loops**

**Definition:**  
Loops are control flow statements that allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. They are fundamental for performing repetitive tasks efficiently.

**Types of Loops in Java:**
- **For Loop**
- **While Loop**
- **Do-While Loop**

Each loop type has its unique use cases and characteristics.

#### **2. For Loop**

**Syntax:**
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Initialization:** Executes once before the loop starts.
- **Condition:** Evaluated before each iteration; loop continues while true.
- **Update:** Executes after each iteration.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Infinite Loop:** If the condition is always true, the loop will never terminate.
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; ; i++) {
      // Infinite loop
  }
  ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What are the three components of a `for` loop?
2. How do you prevent an infinite loop in a `for` loop?
3. Write a `for` loop to print even numbers from 0 to 10.

#### **3. While Loop**

**Syntax:**
```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Example:**
```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Condition:** Evaluated before each iteration; loop continues while true.
- **Potential Infinite Loop:** If the condition is never false, the loop will run indefinitely.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Condition Always True:** Example of infinite loop.
  ```java
  while (true) {
      // Infinite loop
  }
  ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How does a `while` loop differ from a `for` loop?
2. What happens if the condition of a `while` loop is always true?
3. Write a `while` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

---

#### **4. Do-While Loop**

**Syntax:**
```java
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**
```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

**Key Points:**
- **Condition:** Evaluated after the loop body; guarantees at least one execution.

**Edge Cases:**
- **Loop Executes at Least Once:** Even if the condition is initially false.
  ```java
  int i = 10;
  do {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
  } while (i < 5); // Loop will execute once
  ```

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. What distinguishes a `do-while` loop from a `while` loop?
2. Can a `do-while` loop ever be infinite? Provide an example.
3. Write a `do-while` loop to print numbers from 5 to 1 in descending order.

---

#### **5. Nested Loops**

**Definition:**  
A loop inside another loop. Commonly used for multi-dimensional data structures like arrays.

**Example:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Complexity:** Nested loops can significantly increase the time complexity of algorithms.
- **Edge Case:** Infinite nested loops.

**Checkpoint Questions:**
1. How do nested loops affect time complexity?
2. Write a nested loop to print a multiplication table from 1 to 5.
3. Provide an example of a problem where nested loops are necessary.

---

#### **6. Coding Exercises**

**Exercise 1:**  
Write a `for` loop that prints the Fibonacci series up to the 10th term.

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a program using a `while` loop to reverse a given number. For example, input `1234` should output `4321`.

**Exercise 3:**  
Design a `do-while` loop to simulate a basic menu-driven application that prompts the user to select options until they choose to exit.

---

#### **7. Post-Lecture Questions**

1. Explain the differences between `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in Java.
2. Write a code snippet demonstrating an infinite loop in each loop type and discuss how to avoid them.
3. How do nested loops work, and when might they be necessary in programming?
4. Describe a scenario where using a `do-while` loop is more appropriate than a `while` loop.
